    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our website. We are passionate about web development and would like to introduce you to the concept of Model-View-Controller (MVC) and the CodeIgniter framework.</p>

    <h2>What is MVC?</h2>
    <p>MVC is a design pattern used in software development to separate an application into three interconnected components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Model:</strong> Represents the data and business logic of the application.</li>
        <li><strong>View:</strong> Represents the user interface or presentation of the application.</li>
        <li><strong>Controller:</strong> Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, handling user input and updating the Model and View accordingly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is CodeIgniter</h2>
    <p>CodeIgniter is a popular PHP framework that follows the MVC architectural pattern. It provides a robust and easy-to-use foundation for building web applications. CodeIgniter is known for its simplicity and speed, making it an excellent choice for developers who want to create web applications quickly and efficiently.</p>

    <p>Whether you are a beginner looking to learn web development or an experienced developer looking for a reliable framework, CodeIgniter can help you build web applications with ease.</p>
